# N-Dimensional-Projections
## Much of this work was completed in highschool be gentle
A lot of it is not the most efficient code, the work I will do now is mostly focused around formalizing the mathematical methods which I developed.  Not all of the work is my own, the final formula for my general projection algorithm involved the Newton's Method and to find orthogonal basis vectors for my subspaces I apply the Gramâ€“Schmidt process.
